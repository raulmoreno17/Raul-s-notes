/*

Clean code is written over time!

Of course you want to write your best code right from the beginning
    You will allways find ways of improving your code
    As your project evolves and changes, your code will need to change
    ... So, question old code and refactor a lot!

Embrace Refactoring!

- Refactoring today is work you save tomorrow
- A codebase can only survive and stay maintainable if it's continuously
 improved and refactored 
- Pro tip: Whenever you add something new, try to improve existing code 
 along the way
